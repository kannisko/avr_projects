Documentation locates in the Osc_DLL_DOC.txt file.


Advantages:

1.	Speedy performance: the library makes it possible to show on the beams
	of the oscilloscope over a million quantization steps of signal per second
	– less than one micro-second is sufficient for one signal sample.
	This software can be used for linking to real-time controlling programs
	as longer delays in relay of data to the oscilloscope don’t occur.
	The relayed data is instantly displayed in beams, the process of their
	relay and display is deterministic (may be infinite).
	The relayed data is stored in the oscilloscope memory and can be displayed
	graphically as beams at any time – without any “solution” such as
	decimation or excerption, strobe effect	and the like.
	It works regardless of the relay speed.
 
2.	Versatility. Convenient integration with any application-orientated
	software: the on-screen oscilloscope is designed as a DLL exporting
	9 functions, of which 4  are usually enough to work with. The library
	is supplied with a comprehensive description of the program interface
	and simple examples of its use executed in various different program
	development environments: MS Visual C++® & Visual Basic®;
	Borland Delphi® & C++Builder®; MathWorks Matlab® & Simulink®, C# (C Sharp).

3.	A Simple Yet Powerful Interface. A viewing oscilloscope is created
	by this library as a separate window, entirely independent of the program
	which activated it. This window contains all the elements typical
	of a control panel of a real oscilloscope. All the control elements
	are equipped with hints concerning their function. This viewing
	oscilloscope doesn’t create any additional windows with any secondary
	controlling elements or indicators. The library can read any indicated
	ini file (easily edited text format) containing a description of the
	initial oscilloscope properties including: all graphics such as colours,
	type and size of fonts, size of grid cells, display/hide control
	elements options, window caption text, as well as a description of modes:
	number of beams, time and amplitude scales and offsets for each beam
	independently, buffer lengths, modes and levels of triggering, etc.
	Viewing oscilloscope can also save all the current settings onto the
	given ini file, the format of which is described in detail
	in applied documentation.

4.	Convenient data export-import. Data already shown in the oscilloscope
	beams can easily be transferred to other programs via clipboard
	(copy - paste) in text form or via the saved text file. In order
	to do this, select any signal fragment on the oscilloscope monitor –
	- as is done in any text editor program. Text format of exported data
	is universal and simple – it consists of amplitude columns representing
	the time series. The columns are separated by a tabulation symbol.
	In such form data can be easily imported into most “spread sheet”
	kinds of programs – such MS Excel®, as well as into programs
	of the Matlab® type. The oscilloscope also allows such data file to be
	loaded quickly onto its beams.

5.	Reliable and Robust. This library employs only the most basicAPI functions
	and works reliably on all versions of 32- bit MS Windows® starting with the
	’95 version. Before its first release this library was developed and
	robustly tested for over 6 years. During this period it was used in
	a medical monitoring system, in the automobile industry (engine monitoring),
	in motion control systems (servo controllers for electric motors) and
	in metrological studies (development of sensors). Applied software emitting
	data to this oscilloscope obtained data via such communications as serial port
	(RS232, 422, 485), SSI, USB, CAN bus, Ethernet, GRIB (instrumental interface),
	via custom-made communications equipment and also by collecting information
	via a data acquisition card with analog-to-digital converters mounted
	on the PCI bus-bar of a PC. The oscilloscope was also connected to receive
	data flow from a PC sound card. We tested and practically confirmed the
	possibility of relaying data to the scope directly from the computer’s
	hardware interrupt procedure (IRQ) and from any kind of anisochronous
	thread - which is important.
