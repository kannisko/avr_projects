Structure of an Universal PCB board
===================================

- matrix of pads/holes where the leads of the components are inserted
    + typically holes are 1mm of diameter and the pitch is 2.54mm
- sometimes include bus lines (straigth line connecting several pads)
- normally leads are connected on the underside (solder side)

Main methods to join pads
=========================

Ref: http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/55236/how-to-make-traces-on-an-universal-pcb

- solder bridges (use solder to join pads)
    + Procedure for connecting pads:
        -> place components in such a way that leads that need to be connected 
           are placed in adjacent holes.
        -> set your soldering iron to a lower temperature
        -> put some solder on the pads. 
        -> put some solder on your iron and tip in between the pads. Luckily, youâ€™ll connect them.
    + Disadvantage: take a lot of solder, especially long ones.
- jumper/solder wire (typical wire with plastic insulation)
    + typical wire
        Ref: http://www.radioshack.com/50-ft-blue-insulated-wrapping-wire-30awg/2780503.html
        [Note] wire means one single conductor or strand (as opposed to cable)
               Ref: http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-cable-and-wire
    + best for when you can't go around an existing solder joint.
    + without solder: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_wrap
- bare/naked wire (a wire without the plastic wrapper)
    + allows connecting non-adjacent holes easily
    + useful for straight lines and buses, using less solder than solder bridges.
    + disadvantage: could easily make contact with an adjacent pad that should not be connected
- using the leads (legs) of the components
    + procedure: bend the leads (legs) of the components and connect to adjacent pads
    + disadvantage: leads are usually thicker than wire.

Installation:
    - Install Microsoft Visual Basic 5 runtime (Msvbvm50.exe)
      Ref: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/180071
    - Un compress "pass-program.lzh" and "pass-parts.lzh" in a user folder (C:\Users\dsl\pass)
    - Fix locale settings:
        Ref: http://users.wfu.edu/yipcw/atg/microsoft/applocale/
        + Download apploc.mxi > Right-click > Properties > Compatibility with WinXP SP3 > Install it
          Ref: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13209
        + Open C:\Windows\AppPatch\AppLoc.exe with Admin permissions
    - Open AppLoc.exe and follow the wizard to open Pass.exe using Japanese locale
        [Note] check create a link, so you can open directly with launchy! :D
        --> It works!

Overview
    - Upper bar
        + change to 1/2 pitch
            -> this is not related with the board's pitch which is 2.54mm (10 pixels)
               but with a mode that allows you route lines between two pads.
            -> It consumes double memory, so don't use it unless needed.
            -> You can also change to 1/2 pitch mode after finishing, for retouching
               some line. BUT then you cannot go back to normal pitch mode!
        + rotate 90 degrees
        + select 1-side or 2-sides board
    - Left (parts)
        + boards (akiduki), capacitors, connectors, IL connectors, 
          diodes, drill holes, ICs, jacks/terminals, LEDs,
          others (buzzer, transformer, crystal, LCS..), pin headers, 
          pin sockets, transistors, resistors, IC sockets, sensors, switches, 
          labels, tools (fill with color for GND, thru holes), user parts.
    - Right (board)
        + components side (front side)
            -> move mode (for placing parts)
            -> lines mode (for connecting parts)
                + front (red)
                + back (blue) <-- typically use this
                + front using jumper wire (orange)
                + back using jumper wire (green)
                + external line (gray): defines the shape of the board after cutting
            -> zoom 2x (only for connecting parts with lines)
            -> draw/delete a draft
            -> display/hide lines, pin numbers, borders, or labels
            -> save temporarily or periodically, defaults to 10min (alternative to Ctrl-Z)
            -> copy to clipboard (to save it in word or paint)
        + soldering side (back side)
            -> information about amount of wire used
            -> show/hide lines, parts border
            -> refresh
            -> copy to clipboard (to save it in word or paint)

Typical procedure
    - Create new file
        + Choose 'no' if they ask you for 1/2 pitch mode (you can set it later anyway)
    - Move mode (click button with a cursor)
        + Drag a board to the right part, like Akizuki type C (pitch 2.54mm, diagonal 3.58mm)
          Ref: http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gP-03229/
        + Drag parts into the board (maximum: 500)
        + Move parts: left-click + drag
        + Select parts: left-click + drag a rectangle
        + Right-click on a part: delete, copy, rotate, move to other side 
            -> Ctrl-C won't work!
        + Double-click on a part: input reference number and name
    - Line connection mode (click button with the type of line you want to use, or 2-click board)
        + zoom 2x. and click lower-right rectangle to zoom the window
        + paint by dragging
        + right-click menu works here too.
        + try to avoid 90 degree corners, use 45 degree instead
        + if you need to route wires between pads, change to 1/2 pitch mode
        + if you need to cross a line, use thru holes
    - Export the result
        + gerber: use Gonpass addon (based on Gconpass), open in PCBE
          Ref: http://okgnz.web.fc2.com/passcad/index.htm (Gonpass)
          Ref: http://www.geocities.jp/uaubn/gconpass/ (Gconpass)
        + Click on clipboard button, and paste in word or paint

Creating your own parts
    - All parts are BMP files copied to C:\Users\dsl\pass\parts\USR\xxx.bmp (or to a section).
        + Edit with Paint!
    - Boards
        Ref: pass-doc-create-your-board.pdf
        + Max size: 900x550 pixels (970x830 dots)
        + Colors: see the pdf for exact RGB values (or pick them from existing boards)
        + Holes (in white) must be located at (X,Y) that are multiple of 10.
        + Back side: 
            -> change the name xxx.bmp -> xxx_.bmp
            -> the horizontal axis is inverted
            -> the upper-left corner pixel must be the same as the front side
    - Components
        + Pins are 1 red pixel. They must be separated 10 pixels.
        + Pin numbers defined by the red color level (0..255)

Adding lettering
    - use the smallfonts.png as a reference and draw letters/numbers with 
      paint or FireAlpaca pixel-by-pixel.
